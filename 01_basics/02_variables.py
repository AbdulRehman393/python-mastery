# Python Annotation
# Think of annotating a variable as
# if you were to put a label on a container—and anything in that container should hold what the label is describing.
age : int = 34
print(age)

car : str = "Mustang"
print(car)

# Another way to annotate variables is to use type comments where the interpreter will ignore the comments.

captain = "Picard"      # type: str


name : int = "hello"    # it's telling us that here int is expected not string
print(name)

# Any time a library is called, or an IDE works to scan your code, more computational overhead is required.
#
# Pro tip: Be strategic when annotating variables by type. This can add unnecessary overhead when overused.
#
# Type annotation is less common with Python users in data science, as it can be burdensome to manually map data ev
# ery time a new set of data comes in. On the other hand, when doing object-oriented programming or writing functions, using type
# annotations becomes extremely important because it helps clarify code since you are
# dealing with more than just the built-in types.






#Pro tip: If a function expects a list of integers, you should annotate it as List[int],
# not just List. Being specific with your types can catch more potential bugs and misunderstandings.

List_of_numbers: typing.List[int] = [1, 2, 3]
