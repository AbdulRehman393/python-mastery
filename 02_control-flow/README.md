# Conditional Expressions in Python

A comprehensive guide to mastering conditional logic in Python, featuring practical examples of if-elif-else statements, boolean logic, and conditional expressions.

## 📚 Contents

This repository contains three carefully structured modules that build upon each other:

### `01_if_elif_else.py`
Master the fundamentals of Python's conditional flow control. Learn how to write clear, readable conditions using if, elif, and else statements with real-world examples.

### `02_boolean_in_conditional.py`
Dive deeper into boolean logic and how to leverage it effectively in conditional statements. Understand truthiness, boolean operators, and best practices for writing efficient conditions.

### `03_conditional_expressions.py`
Explore Python's ternary operator and conditional expressions. Learn how to write concise, elegant one-liners while maintaining code readability.

## 🎯 Purpose

This learning resource is designed to help Python developers:
- Understand conditional logic from the ground up
- Write cleaner, more Pythonic code
- Master advanced conditional patterns
- Apply best practices in real-world scenarios

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Basic understanding of Python syntax

### Running the Examples

Clone the repository and run any file directly:
```bash
python 01_if_elif_else.py
python 02_boolean_in_conditional.py
python 03_conditional_expressions.py
```

## 💡 Key Topics Covered

**Conditional Control Flow**
- If, elif, and else statements
- Nested conditions
- Multiple condition handling

**Boolean Logic**
- Truthiness and falsiness in Python
- Logical operators (and, or, not)
- Short-circuit evaluation

**Conditional Expressions**
- Ternary operators
- Inline conditionals
- Complex conditional patterns

## 📖 Learning Path

We recommend working through the files in order:
1. Start with `01_if_elif_else.py` for foundational concepts
2. Progress to `02_boolean_in_conditional.py` to strengthen your logic skills
3. Finish with `03_conditional_expressions.py` for advanced techniques

## 💻 Code Quality

All code follows PEP 8 style guidelines and includes:
- Clear, descriptive variable names
- Helpful comments and explanations
- Practical, runnable examples
- Edge case handling
